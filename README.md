# MamemulationStation (es-theme-mameulationstation)
An Emulation Station themed around the MAME emulator.

Based on the following works:
- "es-theme-minimal" by lilbud (https://github.com/lilbud/es-theme-minimal)
- "ckau-book" by Ckau (https://github.com/CkauNui/ckau-book)

This theme was made by warorbs aka [lpb] (https://github.com/lpb/es-theme-mameulationstation)

## Overview

'MAMEulationStation' is a perpetual work in progress and primarily a personal project! :)

The desired impact of the theme is to dress Emulation Station as a front-end for the MAME emulator/framework (https://www.mamedev.org/), specifically the arcade systems.
(An additional theme(s?) for the console/computer might come at a later date though.)

The projected use of this theme is that the user have a central 'all games'/'Mame'/ 'arcade' (as desired) gamelist and then a bunch of collections that break down the games into smaller lists (to aid with navigation and performance), mainly based around publishers and/or system boards.

This theme is primarily designed to be used in grid layout and only with versions of Emulation Station that support theme <formatVersion> 7. (It has been developed on the Batocera port, but should work with others such as EmuELEC and RetroBat).
Other views (basic, detailed) are available but their useability is not (yet, at least) guaranteed.
